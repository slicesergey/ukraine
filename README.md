[while approaching the victim]"Hold on, hold on....Be neater, fuck!" - probably saying that to watch out for the blood.

*Laughing*

[After the Blond guy has used the hammer ]"Hold on, hold on, hold on, don't hit him, don't hit him.....Watch him *the rest is muffled*" - Psycho fuck is probably telling him to watch how he is bleeding as he zooms in the camera to his face. - Camera man

The next part has very bad audio and is very muffled by cans and such. I can make out one or two words but not enough to make out a coherent sentence.

[After the screwdriver stabbing]
"What?.....With what?" - As he responds to the guy who stabs him

"What, he's still alive?!?" - The guy stabbing him exclaims

The response of the camera man I can't make out perfectly because he's speaking very fast and again the quality isn't the best but I believe he says something along the lines of:

"He's still moving his arms after I ripped up his intestines"

The stabber says something along the lines of "He's having a fucked up day" as he steps on his stomach.

[More muffled talk as he proceeds to stab him in the eyes with the screwdriver]

"Get over here fast.....Kill him already."

"What?" - Stabber

"Kill him already."

He says something about his hammer which I believe to be "I already put the hammer back," followed by "He's already dead." - Stabber

"He's not dead and I already poked out his eyes" - Camera man

*Note: There are mainly two of saying the word "dead" in Russian, they're using a term that is phonetically written as "zdoh," which is a way of saying "dead" when talking about animals and things lower life value, such as criminals, if that makes sense*

"Get the knife" - Camera man

*Proceeds to bludgeon him then interrupts by saying something I can't make out*

"More more" - Camera man telling him to keep bludgeoning him to make sure he's dead, and not so much for pleasure any more.

"Hold on, hold on" - Camera man

*They start walking back to the car*

More muffled talk from the blond haired piece of shit

"Wash your hands" - Camera Man

Camera man begins telling him something that I can't make out clearly for some reason but I believe he says "Spray the *name of the chemical*" followed by "I'll hold it," as they started to clean the hammer.

*Muffled talk from the guy washing the hammer*

*More muffled talk from the guy washing his face and walking back from his car*

"I stuck the screwdriver in his brain" - Says the camera man

*Muffled talk from the guy washing his hands*

"I got him in the nose from his eye" - Says the camera man *I'm not exactly sure on this one, but I know he says something along the lines of that.

"I don't understand, how was he alive? I felt his brain" - Says the camera man

"I was holding the screw driver like this *muffled/don't understand*" - Camera man

Before the video ends the blonde says something like "Alright, let's get a picture"
